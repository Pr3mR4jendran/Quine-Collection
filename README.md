# Quine-Collection
A quine is a program that takes no input and prints its own source code. This repository is a collection of quines in various programming and scripting languages.

## Key for file extensions and how to open them with the terminal (because nerds only use the terminal :D):

### .cpp - C++
To run and open C++ files on the terminal, make sure to install GNU compiler. Then run g++ quine.cpp to compile the file. An output file with the extension .out (in my case it was a.out) will be created. Simply type ./a.out to run the executable.

### .cs - C#
To run and open C# files on Windows, use Microsoft Visual Studio. For Mac, first download and install Mono. Then compile the file using mono quine.cs and then run the executable file using mono quine.exe.

### .html - HTML
To run an HTML file simply use the command open quine.html on your terminal.

### .java - Java
To open a Java file on the terminal, make sure you first install the Java JDK. Then simply use java quine.java to compile and execute your java file.

### .js - Javascript
To open a Javascript file on the terminal, make sure to have the Node.Js runtime installed. Then simply use the node quine.js to compile and execute your file.

### .m - Matlab
I used an online compiler for this one, I'll figure out how to configure it using the CLI.

### .pl - Prolog
I used the online SWISH tool for this one, I'll figure out how to configure it using the CLI.

### .py - Python
To open a Python file on the terminal, make sure to have Python (version 3.0 and above installed). Then simply use python3 quine.py to compile and execute your file.

### .r - R
I used an online compiler for this one, I'll figure out how to configure it using the CLI.

### .sh - Bash
To open a Bash script on the terminal, simply use the command sh quine.sh to execute your script.
